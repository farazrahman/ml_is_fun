# ml_is_fun

Let's build some fun Machine Learning projects and practice skills like exploratory analysis, feature engineering, cross-validation techniques and machine learning algorithms to better understand and have a hands on experience. We take the data from Kaggle and develop in a python notebook environment. 

TOPICS:
(I will update the list below as and when I create new projects)

### 1. Predict Youtube Video Likes👍🏽: [EDA+Baseline🕵]
       About the project:
       A regression problem where we have to predict `the like to view_count ratio` of youtube videos based on the title, description, thumbnail and additional metadata. 

### 2. 🧮 Digit Recognizer- Getting started with Tensorflow:
       About the project:
       Correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images from a curated set of MNIST dataset.
